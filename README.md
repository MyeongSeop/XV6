# XV6
XV6 OS Project 


##Project 2

- Make CFS CPU scheduler for XV6 OS. 
- Implement virtual runtime and actual runtime to calulate the time slice of running process.
- Implement system call ps, getpid, getpid. 'ps' system call show current running, sleeping, zombie process and its ID. 'getpid' system call returns current running process's ID. 'setpid' system call set given processor ID to given input value by system call.


##Project 3
- Implement mmap, munmap function in XV6 OS.
- Implement Page Falut Hanlder for XV6. 
- To refer to the mmap and munmap function : https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html


##Prject 4
- Implement page swapping (page replacement) in XV6 OS.
- Manages swappable pages with LRU algorithm. (Clock algorithm)

##Project 5
- Implement file extension in XV6 OS. 
- Used double indirect block to make file extension.
- Implement block group in XV6 OS.

### XV6

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.828, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
